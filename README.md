# Quil — Archived Project Notice

This repository is now **archived** and will no longer receive updates.

Quil was my early attempt at building a desktop companion robot with emotions, audio, touch interaction, themes, and a modular firmware. It served as a foundation to experiment with displays, animations, ESP32 firmware design, audio pipelines, and gesture inputs.

Over time, the project outgrew its structure, naming, hardware choices, and overall direction. Because of that, continuing Quil would have meant stacking new features on top of an outdated base — something that would slow future development.

## 🚫 Why This Project Is Archived

- **A complete redesign was needed**  
  Quil’s original architecture became too limiting as the idea evolved into a more advanced robot.

- **Major feature expansion didn’t fit the old codebase**  
  Things like servo-driven movement, larger ML integration, and personality modules required a cleaner start.

- **Hardware changes**  
  New components, new mappings, and new motion systems didn’t align with the old firmware layout.

- **Vision shift**  
  Quil started as a simple emotion-display bot — the new direction aims for a fully interactive companion robot with far more capabilities.

## 👉 The Successor: **Bagley**

All future development continues under a brand-new project: **Bagley** — a redesigned, more powerful, more scalable robot companion.

Bagley includes:

- A rebuilt architecture  
- TinyML integration  
- Optional local LLM support  
- Better animation handling  
- Servo/movement support  
- Cleaner, future-proof firmware  
- A defined personality system

## ❤️ Thank You

Quil was the first step.  
Bagley is the evolution.

Feel free to explore the old code, but join the new project if you want to follow the real progress.
